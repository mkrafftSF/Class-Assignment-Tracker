Moving forward, I plan to:

Incorporate CI/CD pipelines to automate testing with pytest.
Write integration tests to validate end-to-end functionality.
Continue adopting testing best practices, such as test-driven development (TDD), to streamline the development process.
By prioritizing testing, I have not only improved the reliability of the current project but also laid the groundwork for scalable, maintainable development in future endeavors. This submission includes the commit links, a PDF with test result screenshots, and a detailed summary of my testing journey.
