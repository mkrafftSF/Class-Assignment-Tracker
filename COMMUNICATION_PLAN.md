# Communication Plan

- We will track progress using GitHub Issues and commits.
- Each issue has a designated assignee responsible for implementation.
- After completing an issue, we open a pull request for review (if multiple team members).
- We will share updates and troubleshoot via Slack (or email, if working solo, youâ€™ll log your notes in commits).
