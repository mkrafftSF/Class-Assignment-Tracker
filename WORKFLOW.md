# Git Workflow Strategy

1. **Branch Creation**  
   - For each new issue or feature, create a branch named `issue_UniqueFunction_number`.
   - Example: `issue_InteractiveUI_7`.

2. **Development**  
   - All development is done locally on this separate branch.
   - Code is tested in Jupyter Notebook before committing.

3. **Pull Requests and Merging**  
   - Once the feature is complete, create a pull request to merge into `main`.
   - Another team member (or yourself if solo) reviews the changes, then merges.

4. **Commit Messages**  
   - Use descriptive messages that explain what was changed and why.
